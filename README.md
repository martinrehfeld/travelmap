# Travel Map Visualisation

A little travelmap visualisation built with RaphaÃ«l, Async.js and CoffeeScript.
It was used in the context of a larger presentation and I thought it might be
share-worthy. [Have fun with the demo](http://2013-03-23.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/).

## Setup / Development

* `mm-server` to run local server in development mode
