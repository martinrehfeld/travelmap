# Travel Map Visualisation

A little travelmap visualisation built with RaphaÃ«l, Async.js and CoffeeScript.
It was used in the context of a larger presentation and I thought it might be
share-worthy. Have fun.

## Setup / Development

* `mm-server` to run local server in development mode
* `rake build` to package up
